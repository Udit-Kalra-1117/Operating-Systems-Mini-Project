# Operating-Systems-Mini-Project


This is a team based mini project on the subject Operating Systems of Sem - 4.
This mini project is based on Real - Time Operating System (RTOS).
This mini project includes implementation of 4 algorithms of RTOS for Process Management, Input Output Management, Memory Management and File Management in python language.

The algorithms used are:
      1.  Process Management: Earliest Deadline First Algorithm
      2.  Input Output Management: C-SCAN Algorithm
      3.  Memory Management: Half Fit Algorithm
      4.  File MAnagement: Blowfish Algorithm
